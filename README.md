# handle-external-links

> TLDR: handle-external-links extension for firefox - disables default behaviour of an external url click and provides a popup to copy the url instead.

This extension is **made mainly with Firefox PWA in mind** - I have faced this issue that I am using some site as a firefox PWA, say discord, and someone sends me a URL which I want to open but I click on that **external URL and it runs in the same window closing discord, which is not something you ever want** from an app. Hence, this extension disables this default behaviour for external links and shows a popup to copy the URL instead.

*Open to any suggestions or issues, do raise an Issue or PR if you want :D*
